#In computer science, every written (graphic) character of human language 
# (letters, digits, symbols, etc.) is encoded by assigning it a number. 
# This allows characters to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers. 
# To convert a character to its numerical representation, use the Python ord() function.

#Write a program to print numerical representations of the following characters:

#a, b, z, A, B, Z, 1, =, +, â‚¬

# A program to print numerical representations of characters.

print(f'a {ord('a')}')
print(f'b {ord('b')}')
print(f'z{ord('z')}')
print(f'A{ord('A')}')
